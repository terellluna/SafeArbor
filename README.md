Application Goal:

Safe Arbor is a cryptocurrency arbitrage application designed to profit off of price discrepencies between cryptocurrency exchanges.

The Opportunity/Problem:

This opporutinty exists because of a lack of centralization within the cryptocurrency markets. This opportunity is similar to arbitrage opportunities that exist between sports books. There is no NASDAQ or NYSE of sports books, so anyone with enough capital and willingness to maintain and calculate proper odds for bets can manage a sports book. In a similar manner, anyone willing to maintain a platform to fulfill the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another is capable of running a cryptocurrency exchange. Due to the fact that there are numerous cryptocurrency exchanges, with new exchanges popping up relatively frequently, there are numerous pricing discrepencies for any given cryptocurrency between any given exchange. For example, the price for ETH on FTX might be different from the price of ETH on KuCoin or Gate.io. The major point of this being, if I choose to use any given crpytocurrency exchange, I might not be getting the optimal price for that

Current and Future Goals:

The current goal of the appliation is simply to make money via obvious aribtrage opportunities in order to fund other personal projects/investments. I do, however, have a long term vision for Safe Arbor that involves the broad correction of pricing discrepencies within a decentralized market. I believe that I should be able to sell ETH for the same price no matter what exchange I use. To accomplish this, I view Safe Arbor as a sort of market maker between market makers.
